## Welcome

Welcome to the Brisbane chapter homepage!

We've been a bit quiet during the COVID19 crisis, but we're up and running again!

Virtual meetings for now, but keep your eyes on the meetup for further updates.

## Local News

#### Presenters and Presentations

We are forever looking for volunteers to present at the chapter meetings, so if you've seen something interesting or you have something to say, please let us know.

Often, when we approach potential presenters, we tend to get the following response – “I don’t think my topic is interesting enough”. We just want to stress that as long as the topic is security related – we’re all ears\! We’re just a bunch of nice people wanting to learn/share our knowledge of the security domain. So if you would like to present or know of someone that does, please contact us.

Presentations must be vendor agnostic (no selling of products or services), and please review the Speaker Agreement and information below.

## Participation
The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a nonprofit foundation that works to improve the security of software. All of our projects, tools, documents, forums, and chapters are free and open to anyone interested in improving application security. 

Chapters are led by local leaders in accordance with the [Chapter Leader Handbook](/www-policy/rules-of-procedure/chapter-handbook). Financial contributions should only be made online using the authorized online donation button. To be a SPEAKER at ANY OWASP Chapter in the world simply review the [speaker agreement](/www-policy/speaker-agreement) and then contact the local chapter leader with details of what OWASP Project, independent research, or related software security topic you would like to present.

## Chapter Meetings
Details of OWASP Brisbane chapter meetings will be posted on our meetup page.

Our next meeting is: {% include chapter_events.html group=page.meetup-group %} 

We're still looking at logistics around COVID, and will start having IRL meetings again as soon as we can safely. We're reviewing online options too, so watch this space!
